# PressureChamberCode

Main Developer : Mohamad Nizar Kezzo
Support : Ethienne Racine

This is for the control of a pressure chamber. An MS5803-14BA Pressure Sensor Breakout board ( by SparkFun Electronics)  is used to sense the pressure of the system.
This pressure is correlated with the digital output of a capacitive to digital converter that senses the capacitance of a membrane under the effect of pressure. Communication to both MS5803-14BA and the CDC are done through I2C. Simple stepper motor control is implemented to move a piston.
